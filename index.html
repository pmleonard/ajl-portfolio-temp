                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <h4>Netflix's current model operates as a one-way content delivery system, creating friction points in user retention and content investment decisions. The Household Policy generates user frustration and churn risk, while the platform lacks direct insight into future content preferences beyond viewing patterns. Additionally, existing personalization algorithms face filter bubble limitations, restricting Netflix's ability to make strategic content investments that align with subscriber interests.</h4>
                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <h4>The challenge was to map Netflix’s system, identify high-leverage intervention points that could simultaneously reduce churn, strengthen the connection between revenue and content quality, and create beneficial bidirectional information flows. The proposed intervention addresses a fundamental question: How can Netflix transform from a passive content provider into a collaborative platform where subscribers have agency in shaping the content creation process?</h4>

                <h1>Research and Analysis</h1>
                <p>The research began with a comprehensive inventory of Netflix's system components, organized into three primary categories.</p>
                <img src="images/content/research_dev.png">
                <h1>Establishing System Boundaries</h1>
                <p>After mapping all components, clear system boundaries were established to focus the analysis on the most critical elements affecting user engagement and content investment decisions. This boundary definition allowed me to concentrate on high-leverage intervention points while understanding how they connect to the broader Netflix ecosystem.</p>
                <h1>Mapping Flows and Feedback Loops</h1>
                <p>With components and boundaries defined, relationships between elements were mapped to understand Netflix's core flows and feedback loops. This analysis revealed critical leverage points, particularly around the Household Policy Balancing Loop and the Content Investment Reinforcing Loop.</p>
                <p>Through systems analysis, key friction points were identified: the Household rule creates access denial leading to churn risk and lost revenue, while the platform operates as a one-way content delivery system lacking direct insight into users' future content preferences beyond viewing patterns. Additionally, existing personalization algorithms face filter bubble limitations that restrict strategic content investment decisions.</p>

                <h1>Identifying Leverage Points</h1>
                <p>The research phase focused on understanding how different system elements interact and influence each other. I identified high-leverage intervention points that could simultaneously address multiple challenges: reducing churn, strengthening the revenue-content quality connection, and creating beneficial bidirectional information flows between Netflix and subscribers.</p>
                <p>This analysis revealed a fundamental opportunity: transforming Netflix from a passive content provider into a collaborative platform where subscribers have direct agency in shaping content creation decisions. The insights generated from this systems mapping informed the design of the community-driven voting intervention that addresses multiple leverage points simultaneously.</p>
                <h1>Ideation and Concept Development</h1>
                <p>After identifying critical leverage points in Netflix's system, rapid ideation sessions were conducted to explore multiple intervention strategies. Three primary concepts were sketched and evaluated: a community-driven content voting system allowing subscribers to influence funding decisions before production, a shared group plan for users in different locations, and customizable Netflix carousels for personalized content discovery. Through evaluation against identified leverage points, the community-driven voting system emerged as most promising for transforming Netflix's subscriber relationships while generating valuable content investment data.</p>
